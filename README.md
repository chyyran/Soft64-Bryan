# Notice: #
This is not a fully funtional emulator, its work in progress, and only it runs a basic interpereter.  That means no RCP emulation yet until the CPU is functional and fully tested.

# Project Goals for revision 1 #
* Implement high level graphics system
* Implement high level audio system
* Basic controller support
* Full blown WPF based debugger system
* Implement HLE features into the RCP core
* Implement SRAM, and flash memory
* Fully working "Pure" interpreter
